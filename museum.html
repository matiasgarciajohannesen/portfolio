            <h2>What I would have done different.</h2>
            <p>This site has problems with scaling, the navbar does not exist, the burger menu don’t work and it have a lot of alignment issues. I would like to add JavaScript and make a navbar when the site is scaled for pc and desktop. If I did the assignment again I would love to find a new color template so it would look more appealing. I would love to add more margin to the textboxes on all the different pages so it doesn’t look so crammed together and I also want the text to be aligned with the pictures.
                On may of the sites there is way to much white space and I absolutely would love to make it look better. This site is needs meta descriptions and alt tags as it doesn’t have either. The pictures needs to be edited to make the loading time go down and I would have to make them smaller so that they don’t look so stretched and pixelated.
                The visit site also has the same problems as the rest but here I would like to add a map that shows the location of where the museum is.</p>
